# Python Directory to Google Sheet
Python script that list down and determines the Movies and Series you have in a folder and uploads it into a Google Sheet for reference. 

This was just a fun side project to list down what movies and series I have in a folder and upload it to a sheet so that I can determine if I already have it, it's easy to understand if you need to modify it to your needs.
